                     <h3>WHY YOU SHOULD READ THIS BLOG?</h3>
                     <p>I started this blog to reach out to the entire world, enlightening as many on what herbalism truly is and what it can do for them.

In Africa, people still think herbalism is synonymous to the practice of voodoo, but this is not so.  Plants are a gift from God and there is so much in nature we are yet to explore. 
 
Our desire is that you discover what the intake of pure herbs can do for you. 

On this blog, you will get firsthand information from an expert who has a genuine connection with herbs and nature.  

I will share with you my personal experience from the use of herbs. I will share how people’s lives have been changed, having been transformed from a place of pain to happiness from the use of herbal remedies from Jools herbal.

You will learn to make herbal remedies by yourself with simple things from your kitchen. 


My desire is to add value to your life and giving you all the knowledge you need about herbalism and its benefit; And that our eyes are open to all nature has in store for us.

                     <div class="man-info">
                         <p>My name is Julia Osakuni. 
I am a lover of all things natural. I am a nature freak. The practice of herbalism brings me joy and the feedback from my clients gets me elated.<br/>

My love for nature and herbalism began when I discovered its potency.<br/>

I grew up as a sickly child and gave my parents some trouble. It is from this stand point that my interest in herbs and all things nature grew. I have personally learnt that when herbs heal, it heals completely and it is permanent. It makes one whole again; and the results it brings comes with no side effects.<br/>

Scientists say ‘food is medicine and medicine is food’. <br/>

God has made these plants not just for food but for medicine also.<br/>

In the course of my career, I have been privileged to work with some of the best minds in herbalism.  I have been under the tutelage of experienced and certified professionals (botanists, mycologists and likes) who took me further into the knowledge of herbs.<br/> 

I also shave certification in Microbiology and Business Administration.<br/>
